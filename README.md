# Hopper.io

## Multiplayer Browser Game

Inspired by [Paper.io](http://paper-io.com/), this is a multiplayer version of the popular game by Voodoo. Players compete to try and capture as musch territory as possible by forming a line and linking it back to your terrotiry. Be careful not to touch your own line while doing so, because you will die! You can also crush opponents by hitting them while they're forming a line. Can you claim the biggest territory?

## Live Demo

A live, playable version of the game can be found here (need to add link to deployed site here).

## Tech Stack/Architecture

Hopper.io is built on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) using the Javascript game framework [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) for implementing game mechanics, [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) for client-server interaction, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for HTML rendering, and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for both client and server app state and game state management.
